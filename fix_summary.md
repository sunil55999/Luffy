# Telegram Forwarder Bot - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. URL Forwarding Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: URLs were not being forwarded, messages with links were skipped or failed silently.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced URL detection patterns in `_contains_urls()` method
- Added fallback `_contains_simple_urls()` for edge cases
- Ensured `disable_web_page_preview=False` for all URL messages
- Added comprehensive URL patterns including:
  - HTTP/HTTPS URLs
  - www.domain.com patterns
  - Telegram links (t.me)
  - Common TLD patterns
  - Replit URLs

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `message_processor.py` URL detection logic
- Enhanced `_send_message()` method to properly handle webpage previews
- Added logging for URL detection and preview settings

### 2. pHash-Based Image Blocking ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Image blocking using perceptual hashing was not working properly.

**Solution**:
- Fixed import availability checks for PIL and imagehash
- Added proper error handling for missing libraries
- Enhanced `_get_image_hash()` method with robust error handling
- Fixed similarity calculation with Hamming distance
- Added global and pair-specific image blocking support

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `image_handler.py` with proper library checks
- Fixed type annotations and null safety
- Enhanced database operations for image hash storage
- Added comprehensive logging for image blocking operations

### 3. Global Word Filter ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Block word filter was not working with case-insensitive checks.

**Solution**:
- Integrated with existing config system
- Added environment variable support (`GLOBAL_BLOCKED_WORDS`)
- Implemented case-insensitive word matching
- Added both global and pair-specific word blocking
- Enhanced word boundary detection

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `message_processor.py` `is_blocked_word()` method
- Enhanced `filters.py` with better word filtering logic
- Added configuration support in `config.py`
- Implemented fallback word lists

### 4. Bot API Usage ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Need to ensure all messages are sent via Bot API, not user session.

**Solution**:
- Verified all message sending goes through Bot API
- Enhanced `_send_message()` method for proper bot sending
- Added comprehensive media handling via Bot API
- Maintained original formatting and entities

**Code Changes**:
- Confirmed Bot API usage in all send operations
- Enhanced media processing with file downloads
- Added proper cleanup for temporary files

### 5. Error Logging ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: Need better error logging for URL issues and formatting conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout
- Enhanced exception handling in all critical methods
- Added specific logging for URL processing
- Improved markdown and formatting error messages

**Code Changes**:
- Enhanced logging in `message_processor.py`
- Added error context in `filters.py`
- Improved exception handling in `image_handler.py`

## Technical Implementation Details

### URL Handling
- `disable_web_page_preview=False` for all URL messages
- Enhanced regex patterns for URL detection
- Fallback detection for edge cases
- Proper handling of webpage media types

### Image Blocking
- Perceptual hash (pHash) computation using imagehash library
- Hamming distance similarity calculation
- Global and pair-specific blocking scopes
- Configurable similarity thresholds

### Word Filtering
- Case-insensitive partial matching
- Environment variable configuration
- Global blocked words list with fallbacks
- Integration with existing filter system

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error logging with context
- Graceful fallbacks for library availability
- Type safety improvements

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Global word blocking
GLOBAL_BLOCKED_WORDS="join,promo,subscribe,contact,spam,advertisement,click here"

# Image similarity threshold (Hamming distance)
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=5

# Debug mode for detailed logging
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

### Filter System Features
- Global and pair-specific word blocking
- pHash-based image duplicate detection
- URL preservation with webpage previews
- Comprehensive entity preservation
- Advanced regex pattern support

## Verification Steps

1. **URL Forwarding**: Send messages with URLs to verify webpage previews appear
2. **Image Blocking**: Add image hashes to block list and test duplicate detection
3. **Word Filtering**: Send messages with blocked words to verify filtering
4. **Bot API Usage**: Confirm all messages appear from bot, not user account
5. **Error Logging**: Check logs for detailed error information

All critical issues have been resolved and the system is now running successfully with enhanced functionality.
