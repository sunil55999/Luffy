# Telegram Message Copying Bot System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive, production-ready Telegram message copying bot system with advanced filtering capabilities, multi-bot support, and real-time monitoring dashboard. The system copies messages between Telegram channels/groups with sophisticated filtering, duplicate detection, and load balancing across multiple bot instances.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The system follows a modular, async-first architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Event-driven message processing** using Telethon for listening and python-telegram-bot for sending
- **Multi-bot load balancing** to distribute workload and avoid rate limits
- **Queue-based message processing** with priority handling and retry mechanisms
- **Real-time monitoring** with WebSocket-based dashboard updates
- **SQLite database** with automatic backups and cleanup

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with asyncio
- **Telegram APIs**: Telethon (receiving) + python-telegram-bot (sending)
- **Database**: SQLite with aiosqlite for async operations
- **Web Dashboard**: aiohttp with Jinja2 templating
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets
- **Optional**: Redis for caching (when available)
- **Image Processing**: PIL + imagehash for duplicate detection
